# Contributing

Thanks for looking. Bug reports with a reproduction, and notes on where the
documentation misled you, are the most useful thing you can bring right now.

How this project writes prose — README, `CHANGES`, commit messages,
docstrings, and source comments — is set out separately in
[WRITING.md](WRITING.md). Read that before changing any of it. The constraints
every change is held to, and the map of what is where, are in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Getting set up

Check out the code from GitHub:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:tmux-python/tmuxp.git
```

```console
$ cd tmuxp
```

The easiest way to set up a dev environment is with [uv], which manages the
virtualenv and Python dependencies for you.

Create the virtualenv and install everything locked in `uv.lock`:

```console
$ uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

To refresh those packages later:

```console
$ uv sync --all-extras --dev --upgrade
```

Then prefix any Python command with `uv run`:

```console
$ uv run [command]
```

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv

### Advanced: manual virtualenv

Prefer to manage the virtualenv yourself? Create one:

```console
$ virtualenv .venv
```

Activate it in your current shell:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install tmuxp in editable mode, so your edits take effect immediately:

```console
$ pip install -e .
```

With a uv-managed project, add the checkout as an editable dev dependency
instead:

```console
$ uv add --dev --editable .
```

Prefer a one-off, pipx-style run while you hack? Call tmuxp through [uvx]:

```console
$ uvx tmuxp
```

## The gates

CI is the order of record; every gate it runs has to pass before a change is
done.

Format:

```console
$ uv run ruff format .
```

CI checks formatting without writing:

```console
$ uv run ruff format --check .
```

Lint:

```console
$ uv run ruff check .
```

Autofix what ruff can:

```console
$ uv run ruff check . --fix --show-fixes
```

Type-check:

```console
$ uv run mypy
```

Test:

```console
$ uv run py.test
```

Documentation is a gate, not a courtesy. `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in
`pyproject.toml` sets `testpaths = ["src/tmuxp", "tests", "docs"]` and
`addopts` includes `--doctest-modules`, so every `>>> ` example under
`src/tmuxp/**` and every doctest in a `.py` file under `docs/` runs as part of
`uv run py.test` — there is no separate doctest step, and a green test run is
the proof. `README.md` is not in `testpaths` and is never executed; hold its
examples correct by review. Which blocks qualify, and the one mistake that
silently removes a test, are in
[WRITING.md](WRITING.md#documented-examples-that-run).

Before claiming a test or a gate works, show it failing. A gate that has
never been red is an assumption.

### Imports and typing

- **Namespace imports for the standard library**: `import pathlib`, then
  `pathlib.Path`, not `from pathlib import Path`. Exception:
  `from dataclasses import dataclass, field`, since both are used as
  decorators/defaults, not namespaced. Third-party packages may use
  `from X import Y`.
- **Typing**: `import typing as t`, access via the namespace —
  `t.Optional`, `t.NamedTuple`.
- **Every file** starts with `from __future__ import annotations`; ruff's
  `isort` config (`required-imports` in `pyproject.toml`) enforces it.

Ruff's `select` is deliberately unset in `pyproject.toml` — 0.16's curated
default rule set stays enabled, and `extend-select` layers this project's
additional linters (pydocstyle, flake8-bugbear, and the rest) on top rather
than replacing the defaults.

## Tests

The suite lives in `tests/`, written with [pytest]. It runs against a real
tmux server on a separate socket (`tmux -L test_case`), so it never disturbs
your own sessions.

[pytest]: https://pytest.org/

Write new tests as standalone functions, not `class TestFoo:` groupings —
descriptive function names and file organization carry the structure instead.
A couple of older suites still use classes; match the file you are in, prefer
functions in a new one.

- Prefer the `server`, `session`, `window`, `pane` fixtures from
  `tests/fixtures/` over manual setup, and real tmux fixtures over
  `MagicMock`.
- Use `retry_until` (from `libtmux.test.retry`) for anything that waits on an
  async tmux operation instead of a bare sleep.
- Use the `tmp_path` fixture instead of Python's `tempfile`, and
  `monkeypatch` instead of `unittest.mock`.
- Plugin tests import mock packages from
  `tests/fixtures/pluginsystem/plugins/` — six fixture plugins
  (`tmuxp_test_plugin_bwb`, `_bs`, `_r`, `_owc`, `_awf`, `_fail`) exercising
  each plugin hook and a deliberate failure path.
- Assert on `caplog.records` attributes, not string matching on
  `caplog.text`: scope capture with
  `caplog.at_level(logging.DEBUG, logger="libtmux.common")`, filter records
  rather than index by position, and assert on schema
  (`record.tmux_exit_code == 0`, not `"exit code 0" in caplog.text`).
  `caplog.record_tuples` cannot access `extra` fields.

### Rerun on file change

```console
$ just start
```

Runs the suite once, then watches for changes via [pytest-watcher].

[pytest-watcher]: https://github.com/olzhasar/pytest-watcher

### pytest options

Pass extra arguments through `PYTEST_ADDOPTS`:

```console
$ env PYTEST_ADDOPTS="--verbose" just start
```

Pick a file:

```console
$ env PYTEST_ADDOPTS="tests/workspace/test_builder.py" just start
```

Drop into a single test and stop on the first error:

```console
$ env PYTEST_ADDOPTS="-s -x -vv tests/workspace/test_builder.py::test_automatic_rename_option" \
    just start
```

Drop into `pdb` on the first error:

```console
$ env PYTEST_ADDOPTS="-x -s --pdb" just start
```

Set `RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` if a workspace-builder test is stubborn on your
machine:

```console
$ env RETRY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10 uv run py.test
```

### Manual invocation

A single file:

```console
$ uv run py.test tests/workspace/test_builder.py
```

A single test inside it:

```console
$ uv run py.test tests/test_config.py::test_export_json
```

### Visual testing

Watch the suite build sessions in real time by keeping a client open in a
second terminal.

Terminal 1 — start a server on the test socket:

```console
$ tmux -L test_case
```

Terminal 2 — from the checkout, run the builder tests:

```console
$ uv run py.test tests/workspace/test_builder.py
```

Terminal 1 flickers as sessions build before your eyes — the building tmuxp
normally hides from users.

## Documentation

Rebuild the docs whenever a source file changes:

```console
$ just watch-docs
```

Or build once:

```console
$ just build-docs
```

Serve the built docs locally:

```console
$ just serve-docs
```

`just dev-docs` runs the watcher and the server together; `just design-docs`
adds a static-file watch for theme work. `docs/_build/` is generated —
never hand-edit it.

After you set up your environment, load the project's own workspace from the
checkout root to see a real multi-pane dev layout:

```console
$ tmuxp load .
```

That loads `.tmuxp.yaml` at the project root.

## Releasing

Never create tags. Never push tags. The owner handles tagging and tag pushes,
because a tag triggers the publish workflow. See
[Release commits](WRITING.md#release-commits).

The full release process — updating `CHANGES`, bumping the version, tagging,
and the CI publish to PyPI — is in
[Releasing](../docs/project/releasing.md).

## Pull requests

One subject per pull request. Unrelated cleanup found along the way belongs
in its own commit, and usually in its own pull request.

Discuss a substantial change via an issue before making it.

Run the gates above before opening a pull request; update documentation if
your change affects the public interface. A pull request merges once it has
the sign-off of one other developer — if you cannot merge it yourself,
request a reviewer to do so.

Commit format is in [WRITING.md](WRITING.md#commits).
